            <p> Mobile Verification application is an application that allows users that are looking to
                purchase used phones to search for the previous owner of a phone online using the IMEI number. </p>

            <p>The IMEI number can be checked in different ways depending on the type of phone. For most phones
                it can be found in general settings but for phones where it is not available in the settings, instructions
                can be found online. </p>

            <p>We are currently located at Robert Gordon University which can easily be located with google maps.</p>
