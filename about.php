            <p> Mobile Verification application is an application that allows users that are looking to
                purchase used phones to search for the previous owner of a phone online using the IMEI number. </p>

            <p>In order for this to work the mobile phone has to be registered on he platform. <br><br>The IMEI number of a mobile device can be checked in different ways depending on the type of phone. For most phones
                it can be found in general settings or by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong> . This code should work on most phones but for phones where it is not available in the settings, instructions
                can be found online. </p>
